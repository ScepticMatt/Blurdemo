A-buffer motion blur demo

Use mouse buttons to toggle settings (mouse left=blur, mouse right=speed)
blur = 0: no motion blur
blur = 1: assumes perfect eye-tracking
blur = 2: assumes fixed eye (shutter behaviour)

You will need the GLUT <http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/>  libraries to compile this program.
