Blurdemo

A-buffer motion blur demo. 

========
How to use:

Use mouse buttons to toggle settings (mouse left=blur, mouse right=speed)
blur = 0: no motion blur
blur = 1: assumes perfect eye-tracking
blur = 2: assumes fixed eye (shutter behaviour)

You will need the GLUT <http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/>  libraries to compile this program.

Introduction:
The human eye has a limited sampling rate called critical flicker fusion(CFF),
highly depending on viewing conditions such as object brightness, size and periphery,

CFF(E,L,d, p) ~= (0.24E + 10.5)(Log L+log p + 1.39 Log d - 0.0426E + 1.09) (Hz)
E = eccentricity in degrees
L = eye luminance in Troland, 
d = stimulus diameter in degree
p = pupil area in mm2

(Poggel et al, 2006)

Objects shown on computer screens are typically time descrete, at 24, 30 or 60 Hz.(1)
The interaction between object update rate and CFF results in various artifacts
such as strobing, ghosting or the phantom array effect amongst others.
These efects can be seen up to 10,000 Hz (ASSIST, 2005), 
or 700 Hz in typical TV viewing conditions (EBU/2015)

A more practical sultion is to use Motion blur (i.e. temporal anti-aliasing),
If the update rate satisfies the Nyquist limit and eye movement is known,
'perfect' motion(1) is achieveable without the high rate requirement mentioned above.

(1) assumes display persistence is shorter than 1/CFF, otherwise persistence blur is introduced.
